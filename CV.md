Experience
----------

**Graduate Research Assistant: [Biomedical Acoustics Laboratory, University of Cincinnati](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound)**

Conducted experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis to solve biomedical acoustics problems. Included in these investigations was the quantitative detection and analysis of acoustic emissions from cavitating bubbles during sonophoresis. 

* Investigated ultrasound-enhanced transdermal delivery of nanoscaled drugs
* Developed an _in vitro_ sonophoresis system for autonomous (MATLAB) treatment and data aquisition
* Conducted spectral analysis of acoustically-measured cavitation bubble  emissions (MATLAB)
* Conducted data/statistical analyses on measured quantities (MATLAB/R)
* Identified [mechanisms of ultrasound-enhanced skin permeability (sonophoresis)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC)
* Measured,  simulated, and reconstructed transmitted, received, and scattered acoustic fields 
* Developed [standard techniques for quantitative acoustic measurements](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) 
* Developed [standard guidlines for accurate calibration measurements](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)
* Developed theory for quantifying cavitation activity from quantitative acoustic measurements
* Conducted validation simulations (Monte Carlo) and measurements 


**Underaduate Research Assistant: Solid State Physics Lab, Northern Kentucky University**

Investigated the crystalline structure and electrical properties of bulk-produced CoFe(x)O(y) (cobalt ferrite) composites for potential pressure sensors applications
