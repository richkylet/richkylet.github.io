Education
---------

2016 (expected)
:   **PhD, Biomedical Engineering**; University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH)

    *Thesis title: *

2007-2010
:   **BSc, Physics**; Northern Kentucky University (Highland Heights, KY)

    *Minor: Mathematics*


Experience
----------

**Graduate Research Assistant: [Biomedical Acoustics Laboratory, University of Cincinnati](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound)**

Conducted experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis to solve biomedical acoustics problems. Included in these investigations was the quantitative detection and analysis of acoustic emissions from cavitating bubbles during sonophoresis. 

* Investigated ultrasound-enhanced transdermal delivery of nanoscaled drugs
* Developed an \textit{in vitro} sonophoresis system for autonomous (MATLAB) treatment and data aquisition
* Conducted spectral analysis of acoustically-measured cavitation bubble  emissions (MATLAB)
* Conducted data/statistical analyses on measured quantities (MATLAB/R) 
* Measured,  simulated, and reconstructed transmitted, received, and scattered acoustic fields %(MATLAB)
* Developed standard techniques for quantitative acoustic measurements %calibrating the receive sensitivity of single-element ultrasound transducers for
* Developed theory for quantifying cavitation activity from quantitative acoustic measurements
* Conducted validation simulations (Monte Carlo) and measurements 


**Underaduate Research Assistant: Solid State Physics Lab, Northern Kentucky University**

Investigated the crystalline structure and electrical properties of bulk-produced CoFe(x)O(y) (cobalt ferrite) composites for potential pressure sensors applications
 
 
Technical Skills
--------------------



Programming Languages
:   **Software/Programming::** MATLAB, LaTeX, Mathematica, Unix/Linux environment  

	* basic knowledge: R, SAS, Python (SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas)

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

[ref]: https://github.com/githubuser/superlongprojectname

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...
    
    

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
