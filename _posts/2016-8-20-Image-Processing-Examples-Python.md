### Basic image processing (image filtering for various effects): `imageProcessingExamples.py`


**Basic descritpion:** simple script for various image processing examples. (see: [`imageProcessingExamples.py`](https://github.com/richkylet/analysis-tools/blob/gh-pages/imageProcessingExamples.py)).
This is part of a [collection of basic scripts](https://github.com/richkylet/analysis-tools) used for analysis during my PhD. 


Information: Here are a few basic examples of image processing with  spline, convolved, and guassian type filters for edge, shift, and blurred effects/processing.
