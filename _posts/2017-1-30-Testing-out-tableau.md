### My introduction to Tableau

![]({{site.baseurl}}https://github.com/richkylet/richkylet.github.io/blob/master/images/sf.png?raw=true)


This is my first interaction creating a dashboard and visualizations using Tableau. 
As an example data set, I am starting off with San Francisco crime data that was hosted for a Kaggle competition ([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime)). 
Note that this is a work in progress and is purely introductory for myself (this will be a nice place for me to reflect upon later in life as my experience and skill level increases with this tool). 
It should also be noted how quickly Tableau can be adapted to create really nice, interactive and functional visualizations. 
Really, I can not stress how quickly this tool can be adapted and employed to visualize your data in a very clean, organized dashboard. 


See the dashboard I am creating [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/sf_crime/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes). 
For this data set, the first order of business was to organize the data in order to display a geospatial map of crimes committed. 
Second, in addition to geospatial data, this data set also includes time series data so I began plotting crimes as function of time.
Again, this is just practice for me to being interacting with Tableau and a gallery of other peoples creative efforts can be viewed on the [public.tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery) website.
