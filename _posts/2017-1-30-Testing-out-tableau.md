This is my first interaction creating a dashboard and visualizations using Tableau. 
As an example data set, I am starting off with San Francisco crime data that was hosted for a Kaggle competition ([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime)). 
Note that this is a work in progress and is purely introductory for myself (this will be a nice place for me to reflect upon later in life as my experience and skill level increases with this tool). 
It should also be noted how quickly Tableau can be adapted to create really nice, interactive and functional visualizations. 


See the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/sf_crime/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes). 
The first order of business was to organize the data in order to display a map of crimes. 
Second, in addition to geospatial data, this data set also includes time series data so I began plotting crimes as function of time.
