Signal & Image Processing example scripts
-------------------

I finally generated some very basic signal (`signalProcessingExamples.py`) and image (`imageProcessingExamples.py`) processing python scripts. 
I figured these would serve as nice examples for people looking for code with example problems that are easily modified to fit other applications.  

All code has been generalized from its original use to serve as a starter for anyone new to signal & image processing in python.
