# Repository for kaggle challenges
[Here](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges) I started a repository for Kaggle challenges that I have began to work on in the minimal free time that I currently have. I'll be editing and updating these with time. Currently, I have been looking at the [Titanic](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges/blob/master/titanic.ipynb) and [Whale Call](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges/blob/master/kaggleWhales.ipynb) data sets using iPython/Jupyter. I plan on attempting to analyze other data sets in the near future.
