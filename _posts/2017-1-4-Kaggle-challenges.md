# Repository for kaggle challenges
[Here](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges) I started a repository for Kaggle challenges that I have began to work on in the minimal free time that I currently have. These are currently at very initial stages and are being conducted just for fun, so I'll be editing and updating these with time. 

Currently, I have been looking at the [Titanic](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges/blob/master/titanic.ipynb) and [Whale Detection](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges/blob/master/kaggleWhales.ipynb) data sets using iPython/Jupyter, but I plan on attempting to analyze other data sets in the near future.  

The original challenges can be found for the [Whale Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-detection-challenge) and [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) data sets on kaggle.com.
