# Repository for kaggle challenges
[Here](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges) I started a repository for Kaggle challenges that I have started to work on in the minimal free time that I currently have. I'll be editing and updating these with time. Currently, I have been looking at the Titanic and Whale Call data sets, but I plan on attempting to analyze other data sets in the near future.
