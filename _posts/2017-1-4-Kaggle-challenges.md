# Repository for kaggle challenges
[Here](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges) I started a repository for Kaggle challenges that I have began to work on in the minimal free time that I currently have. These are currently at very initial stages and are being conducted just for fun, so I'll be editing and updating these with time. 

Currently, I have been looking at the [Titanic](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges/blob/master/titanic/titanic_prediction.ipynb) and [Whale Detection](https://github.com/richkylet/kaggleChallenges/blob/master/whale%20sounds/kaggleWhales.ipynb) data sets using iPython/Jupyter, but I plan on attempting to analyze other data sets in the near future.  

The original challenges can be found for the [Whale Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-detection-challenge) and [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) data sets on kaggle.com. 
For the Titanic challenge, analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive was conducted. In particular, machine learning was emoployed using a Random Forests algorithm to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. This analysis serves as an introduction to machine learning and sorting through data that includes various types of variables, missing data, etc.
