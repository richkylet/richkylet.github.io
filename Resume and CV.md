Education 
---------

2016 (expected): PhD, Biomedical Engineering
:   **University of Cincinnati**  Cincinnati, OH

    *Dissertation title: Characterization of cavitation effects in therapeutic ultrasound: sonophoresis experiments and quantitative emission measurements*

2008: BS, Physics
:   **Northern Kentucky University**  Highland Heights, KY

    *Minor: Mathematics*


Technical Skills
--------------------

**Software/Programming:** MATLAB, Python (SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas\*), LaTeX, Mathematica, R (ggplot2 \*), Unix/Linux environment
(\* basic knowledge)

**Technical:** Acoustic simulation and characterization, numerical simulations, Monte Carlo methods, instrument control, signal analysis, data processing and visulization

**Statistical:** Regression, uncertainty propagation, correlation, and
distribution testing, parametric and non-parametric analyses of variance and covariance, and binary classifier system (ROC analysis)



Research Experience
----------

**Graduate Research Assistant: [Biomedical Acoustics Laboratory, University of Cincinnati](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound)**

Conducted experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis to solve biomedical acoustics problems. Included in these investigations was the quantitative detection and analysis of acoustic emissions from cavitating bubbles during sonophoresis. 

* Identified [mechanisms of ultrasound-enhanced skin permeability (sonophoresis)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC). Developed algorithms for signal processing (MATLAB) and statistical analysis (R) of >300 GB of data, leading to discovery of empirical relationship between microbubble cavitation mechanisms and skin permeabilization.
* Developed [techniques for charcterization of acoustic receivers.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C)  Conducted numerical simulations (Python and MATLAB) to validate these techniques using models for transmitted and radiated acoustic field measurements in tissue and fluid, resolving calibration measurement accuracy to less than 1 dB.  
* Developed [standard guidlines for accurate calibration measurements](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=yQ-Tm_oAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC). Conducted numerical simulations (MATLAB) to validate these techniques using models for scattered acoustic field measurements in tissue and fluid, resolving calibration measurement accuracy to less than 1 dB.
* Conducted research leading to development of measurement and signal processing techniques for quantitative characterization of microbubble cavitation in fluids or tissues during therapeutic ultrasound. Developed analytic model to account for random diffraction effects and using measured pressures to estimate the acoustic power radiated by bubbles to within 1 dB accuracy. 
* Fabricated and programmed novel devices for autonomous monitoring of acoustic fields, acoustic emissions from microbubble cavitation, and in vitro skin permeabilization and electrical resistance using instrument control algorithms developed in MATLAB.
* Experience presenting data-driven result to technical and non-technical audiences, and publishing results


**Underaduate Research Assistant: Solid State Physics Lab, Northern Kentucky University**

* Conducted research investigating bulk-produced CoFe(x)O(y) (cobalt ferrite) composites for potential pressure sensors applications. 
* Developed and manufactured composites, performed characterization analysis using WAXS and impedance spectroscopy, and data analysis with Mathematica.
