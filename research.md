Bubbles may interact with tissue during therapeutic ultrasound and enhance the therapeutic effect. The excitation of bubbles by exposure to ultrasound is called acoustic cavitation: the nucleation and subsequent pulsation and/or collapse of a gas-filled bubble that is physically driven by the applied oscillating sound field.

Below is an example depicting the potential interaction of cavitation bubbles with skin during sonophoresis, the use of ultrasound to increase the permeability of skin for enhanced drug delivery:
