### Bubbles and therapeutic ultrasound ###
Bubbles may interact with tissue during therapeutic ultrasound and enhance the therapeutic effect. The excitation of bubbles by exposure to ultrasound is called acoustic cavitation: the nucleation and subsequent pulsation and/or collapse of a gas-filled bubble that is physically driven by the applied oscillating sound field. A variety of ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery applications are currently being researched including [stroke treatment](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound/research#topic1) and [transdermal drug delivery](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914005896), for example. 

Below is an example depicting the potential interaction of cavitation bubbles with skin during sonophoresis, a treatment that employs ultrasound to increase the permeability of skin for enhanced drug delivery:
