### Bubbles and therapeutic ultrasound ###
Bubbles may interact with tissue during therapeutic ultrasound and enhance the therapeutic effect. The excitation of bubbles by exposure to ultrasound is called acoustic cavitation: the nucleation and subsequent pulsation and/or collapse of a gas-filled bubble that is physically driven by the applied oscillating sound field. A variety of ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery applications are currently being researched including [stroke treatment](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound/research#topic1) and [transdermal drug delivery](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914005896), for example. 

Below is an example depicting the potential interaction of cavitation bubbles with skin during sonophoresis, a treatment that employs ultrasound to increase the permeability of skin for enhanced drug delivery:

Generally, cavitation comes in two flavors: stable and inertial. Stable cavitation is the repetitive pulsation of a bubble, while inertial describes the rapid expansion and violent collapse of a bubble. These two different kinds of behavior are associated with different mechanisms by which the bubbles interact with tissue. For example, during sonophoresis, stable cavitation may lead to fluid flows around the bubble wall that induce a shear force, pulling the skin apart. Inertial cavitation may generate micron-scaled jets of fluid that impact the skin, making pores. 

The presence of either bubble type can be determined by listening to the sound that each makes. 


### The sound of bubbles ###

As a bubble oscillates (stable) or collapses (inertial), it generates its own sound field. The field generated by a bubble can be listened to using a passive ultrasound transducer in 'listen-only mode', typically called a 'passive cavitation detector' (PCD).  

Additionally, each cavitation type generates signature acoustic emissions or sounds. For example, a collapsing bubble generates sound as white noise (an increase in noise in all frequencies) and a stable, pulsating bubble generates sound at half the driving treatment frequency (the subharmonic). The figure below depicts a cavitation bubble generating a sound field, a PCD ‘listening’ to the bubble, and the frequency spectra of the signal measured by the PCD. The signal shows an increase in broadband noise (in red: indicating broadband emissions from inertial, collapsing cavitation bubbles) and a spike at f/2, the subharmonic (in blue and red, indicating emissions from a stable oscillating bubble).

The sound generated by either cavitation type can be measured during therapeutic ultrasound treatments to determine the presence, type, and intensity of specific cavitation activity. 

### The first challenge with listening to bubbles: non-quantitative measurements ###
Typically, PCD measurements (the measured sound radiated by cavitation bubbles) is measured and reported in non-physical units. This makes it really challenging to compare our results with other labs, since the measured sound is dependent on the PCD, the system used to record the sound/signal, and the location of the PCD to the cavitation sources. 

To address the issues associated with the PCD and system, we have developed methods for calibrating the PCD and system in order to convert the recorded signal into a an acoustic pressure value. This requires the calibration of the PCD, which can be conducted using various methods (see [here](http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/138/3/10.1121/1.4929620) and [here](http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/138/5/10.1121/1.4935080)). Calibrating the PCD allows us to measure directly the radiated sound pressure by cavitation bubbles that reaches the PCD. 


### The second challenge with listening to bubbles: system-dependent measurements ###
So now we can measure the acoustic pressure radiated by cavitation bubbles at the surface of our PCD. However, the 'amount' of sound received by the PCD is dependent on the location of our PCD relative to the location of the cavitation bubble(s). To better explain this point, consider the cumulative sound field generated by a random ensemble of point radiators (cavitation bubbles represented as the blue dots, each generating their own spherically propagating field) in the next image:

Note that the random ensemble of sources generates a cumulative field that has random directivity. Meaning, the cavitation generated sound field does not propogate with the same intensity in all directions and the pressure measured at different locations may result in erroneous measurements due to the various peaks and nulls distributed spatially throughout the generated sound field. 

Further complicating this measurement challenge, the measured signal is dependent on the size and shape of the PCD, as well as the frequency of the radiated sound. To combat these various measurement issues, we are developing methods to make quantitative measurements that characterize the cavitation bubbles as acoustic sources directly, and are independent of the PCD, system, or frequency used for measurements. We are investigating this challenge using a variety of methods including theory, numerical simulations using Monte Carlo methods, and experimental measurements. Results are coming soon.
