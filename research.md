### Bubbles and therapeutic ultrasound ###
Commonly recognized as a diagnostic imaging modality, ultrasound is also used for therapeutic applications to treat ailments including [cancer](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound/research#topic5), [stroke](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound/research#topic1), Parkinson’s disease, as well as for various [directed drug delivery](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound/research#topic2) applications.  
For the majority of these therapeutic applications, the primary mechanisms providing the desired therapeutic bioffect is a phenomena referred to as acoustic cavitation. 

Acoustic cavitation is the nucleation and subsequent pulsation and/or collapse of micron-sized, gas-filled bubbles that are physically driven by the applied oscillating sound field (ultrasound). Cavitation activity can occur within and interact with tissue, vasculature, or fluids (e.g. blood) during ultrasound exposure. 
This interaction may lead to a variety of bioeffects, which are typically avoided for diagnostic applications but may be exploited to permeabilize biological barriers such as skin, the blood-brain barrier, or vasculature to increase localized and targeted drug delivery. 
Hence, fundamental to ultrasound exposure safety is proper monitoring and measuring techniques of cavitation to asses treatment progress and provide  dosimetry  metrics for avoiding potentially harmful exposures both for treatment and for diagnostic purposes.
However, there are currently no standard measurement or analysis techniques for this sort of assessment or monitoring. 

#### The majority of my PhD work has been centered around developing a greater understanding of bubble physics, their interactions with tissue for enhanced drug delivery applications, and developing methods to monitor their presence, intensity, and acoustic energy dose delivered to tissue. ####



## Sonophoresis: ultrasound-enhanced transdermal drug delivery ##

 Transdermal drug delivery generally refers to the topical application of drugs with the goal of absorption into the deeper skin layers for local and regional delivery or for systemic absorption. 
 The transdermal path as an alternative drug delivery route is significant as it alleviates pre-systemic absorption and metabolism of drugs by the GI tract and stomach, the skin is easily accessible, and offers the potential for sustained and controlled delivery of drugs. 
 However, the skin itself acts as a resistor to drug penetration, only letting a select few types and sizes of drugs across the skin (e.g., nicotine and estradiol). One method to increasing skin permeability to drugs is the use of ultrasound, a treatment referred to as sonophoresis. 
 For sonophoresis, increased skin permeability is believed to be initiated by the interaction of cavitation with the skin surface. 

Generally, cavitation comes in two types, defined by their dynamic response to ultrasound: stable and inertial. Stable cavitation is the repetitive pulsation of a bubble, while inertial describes the rapid expansion and violent collapse (due to being overcome by inertia) of a bubble. These two different kinds of behavior are associated with different mechanisms by which the bubbles interact with tissue. For example, during sonophoresis, stable cavitation may lead to fluid flows around the bubble wall that induce a shear force, pulling the skin apart. Inertial cavitation may generate micron-scaled jets of fluid that impact the skin, making pores. 
These examples are depicted below:

The specific types and locations of cavitation were investigated and identified, compared with changes in skin permeability, and the results published in the [Journal of Controlled Release](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914005896). Methods for identifying the the presence of cavitation are described below. 

## The sound bubbles make ##

The presence of cavitation and the specific type occurring can be distinguished during therapy by ‘listening’ to the sound generated by a bubble. 
As the bubbles oscillate or collapse, they generate their own distinct sound that can be ‘listened’ to by using another transducer, referred to as a passive cavitation detector (PCD). 
For example, pulsating bubbles generate sound at a frequency half of that of the driving transducer and collapsing bubbles generate white noise (sound energy across a wide spectrum). 
Spectral analysis of the time-domain sound measured by the ‘listening’ PCD can reveal the presence and relative intensity of either of these cavitation types. 

An example of this process is depicted below is a cavitation bubble generating its own sound field which is measured by the PCD, and the frequency spectrum of the measured sound is shown. 
The signal shows an increase in broadband noise (in red: indicating broadband emissions from inertial, collapsing cavitation bubbles) and a spike at f/2, the subharmonic (in blue and red, indicating emissions from a stable oscillating bubble).

## A challenge with dosimetry: how much power is transmitted into tissue by bubbles? ##
From a dosimetry standpoint, in order to ensure patient safety, two equally important issues arise: (1) how much energy are these bubbles delivering to the tissue and (2) how much energy is required to generate a desired bioeffect?
These are challenging questions to answer. 
PCD measurements are commonly employed to identify the amount and type of cavitation activity present. 
However, these measurements are system-dependent and only reveal relative values. 
That is, the measurements to not assess the physical energy generated by the observed bubbles due to the signal generated by the PCD being dependent on the frequency-response of the electronics and its own frequency-dependent sensitivity to measured sound. 
The first step to overcoming this issue is to make our  measurements in physical units. 


To address the issues associated with the PCD and system, we have developed methods for calibrating the PCD and system in order to convert the recorded signal into a an acoustic pressure value. This requires the calibration of the PCD, which can be conducted using various methods (see [here](http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/138/3/10.1121/1.4929620) and [here](http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/138/5/10.1121/1.4935080)). Calibrating the PCD allows us to measure directly the radiated sound pressure by cavitation bubbles that reaches the PCD. 


So now we can measure the acoustic pressure radiated by cavitation bubbles at the surface of our PCD. However, the ‘amount’ of sound received by the PCD is dependent on the location of our PCD relative to the location of the cavitation bubble(s). To better explain this point, consider the cumulative sound field generated by a random ensemble of point radiators (cavitation bubbles represented as the blue dots, each generating their own spherically propagating field) in the next image:

If we were to measure the field generated by these bubbles at different locations, even if we measured in units of pressure, we are not guarenteed to make the same measurement. 

To address this secondary issue, we are currently developing theory and methods for taking our quantitative PCD measurement and relating that to the power radiated by an ensamble of cavitation sources. Hence, we will be able to indirectly quantify the amount of energy delivered locally to tissue by cavitation bubbles.  We are investigating this challenge using a variety of methods including theory, numerical simulations using Monte Carlo methods, and experimental measurements. Results are coming soon.
