### Bubbles and therapeutic ultrasound ###
Bubbles may interact with tissue during therapeutic ultrasound and enhance the therapeutic effect. The excitation of bubbles by exposure to ultrasound is called acoustic cavitation: the nucleation and subsequent pulsation and/or collapse of a gas-filled bubble that is physically driven by the applied oscillating sound field. A variety of ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery applications are currently being researched including [stroke treatment](http://med.uc.edu/ultrasound/research#topic1) and [transdermal drug delivery](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365914005896), for example. 

Below is an example depicting the potential interaction of cavitation bubbles with skin during sonophoresis, a treatment that employs ultrasound to increase the permeability of skin for enhanced drug delivery:

Generally, cavitation comes in two flavors: stable and inertial. Stable cavitation is the repetitive pulsation of a bubble, while inertial describes the rapid expansion and violent collapse of a bubble. These two different kinds of behavior are associated with different mechanisms by which the bubbles interact with tissue. For example, during sonophoresis, stable cavitation may lead to fluid flows around the bubble wall that induce a shear force, pulling the skin apart. Inertial cavitation may generate micron-scaled jets of fluid that impact the skin, making pores. 

The presence of either bubble type can be determined by listening to the sound that each makes. 


### The sound of bubbles ###

As a bubble oscillates (stable) or collapses (inertial), it generates its own sound field. The field generated by a bubble can be listened to using a passive ultrasound transducer in 'listen-only mode', typically called a 'passive cavitation detector' (PCD). If the PCD is [calibrated properly](http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/138/3/10.1121/1.4929620), the radiated sound pressure at the PCD can be quantitatively measured.  

Additionally, each cavitation type generates signature acoustic emissions or sounds. For example, a collapsing bubble generates sound as white noise (an increase in noise in all frequencies) and stable, pulsating bubbles generate sound at half the driving frequency or subharmonic. A bubble generating a sound field, measured by a PCD is depicted below. The signal shows an increase in broadband noise (in red: indicating broadband emissions from inertial, collapsing cavitation bubbles) and a spike at f/2, the subharmonic (in blue and red, indicating emissions from a stable oscillating bubble).
